While a definitive solution remains elusive due to the bug's inconsistent nature, here are some potential workarounds that may help mitigate the issue:

**1. Permissions Check and Handling:**
   Ensure you have correctly requested and handled camera permissions. Explicitly check permissions before attempting to access the camera.

```javascript
import * as Permissions from 'expo-permissions';

const { status } = await Permissions.askAsync(Permissions.CAMERA);

if (status !== 'granted') {
  // Handle permission denial
}
```

**2. Aspect Ratio Adjustment:**
   Experiment with different aspect ratios for the camera preview. Occasionally, specific aspect ratios might resolve compatibility issues on certain devices.

```javascript
<Camera style={styles.camera} type={Camera.Constants.Type.back} ratio={'16:9'}/>
```

**3. Device-Specific Configurations:**
   If possible, try testing on various Android devices to determine any common patterns. This might help isolate the devices or configurations most susceptible to the bug.

**4. Expo SDK Version:**
   Consider checking if updating or downgrading the Expo SDK version resolves the issue.  Inconsistent behavior across SDKs might indicate underlying Expo API changes impacting camera functionality.

These workarounds are not guaranteed solutions and depend greatly on the root cause of the issue on the individual device. Further investigation may be required to find a permanent fix.
