## Expo Camera Preview Issue on Android

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API on certain Android devices. The camera preview fails to render, displaying a blank screen instead.  The issue is intermittent and lacks clear error messages in the console logs. This makes debugging challenging.  The `bug.js` file reproduces the problem, while `bugSolution.js` (if found) offers a potential workaround or fix.  Contributions and solutions are welcome!

**To reproduce:**
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the app on an affected Android device (device specifics may vary).
4. Observe the blank camera preview screen.

**Note:** The bug's inconsistency makes it difficult to pinpoint the exact cause. Device-specific configurations or underlying Android system variations might be factors.
